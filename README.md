# Command-Line Password Generator

This is a simple yet effective command-line tool written in Python that generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. Users can specify the desired length and choose to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Features

* **Customizable Length:** Set the exact number of characters for your password.
* **Character Set Options:** Include or exclude:
    * Lowercase letters (always included by default)
    * Uppercase letters
    * Numbers (0-9)
    * Symbols (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`)
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive prompts guide the user through the password generation process.
* **Input Validation:** Handles invalid input for length and ensures at least one character type is chosen.
